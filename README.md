# Implantable-Cardiac-Defibrillator-Design-with-Troponin-level-Measurement

The Implantable Cardiac-Defibrillators (ICDs) traces back to the late 20th century, marked by pioneering 
efforts in cardiac electrophysiology. The concept of an implantable device capable of delivering life-saving 
electrical shocks to restore normal heart rhythm emerged in the 1970s. The first successful implantation 
of an ICD in a human patient occurred in 1980 by Dr. Michel Mirowski and his team. This groundbreaking 
achievement laid the foundation for the development and widespread use of ICDs as a critical intervention 
for individuals at risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias. Over the years, technological 
advancements have refined ICD designs, improving their reliability, programmability, and capabilities.
According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of 
death. Around 18 million people died of cardiac causes in 2016, accounting for over 30% of all mortality 
worldwide. Sudden cardiac death (SCD), most often induced by ventricular arrhythmias, is one of the main 
reasons for CVD-related deaths. Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of SCD with up 
to 80% of all patients suffering from SCD. etc...
